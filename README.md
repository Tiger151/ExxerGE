# ExxerGE
This project is to create a Java based game engine that can be scaled up over time for future computing improvements.
The project's test game is focused on creating a WWII factory simulation game.
At the moment the engine is capable of supporting hardcoded GUI elements, a tile system, and basic input handling including mouse support. 
## Build
Developed in Eclipse.
No special build instructions ATM.
## Contributing
Anyone may contribute to the project so long the codebase stays Java or Scala.
